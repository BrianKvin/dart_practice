# dart_practice

Welcome to the **dart_practice** repository! This is where I document and store all my practice projects, coding challenges, and anything related to Dart and Flutter development.

## Purpose

The **dart_practice** repository serves as a collection of various experiments, learning exercises, and small projects I work on to improve my skills in Dart and Flutter. Each folder or subdirectory represents a different practice area or project that I’ve explored. This is a great resource if you're looking to see how I’ve approached different problems or if you want to follow along with my learning journey.

### Projects include (but are not limited to):
- Flutter UI challenges and widgets.
- Dart algorithms and data structures.
- Small applications built with Flutter.
- Flutter integration with third-party libraries.
- Exploring different Flutter packages and plugins.
- Other learning exercises related to Dart and Flutter development.

## Table of Contents

Here’s a list of some of the main folders or topics that you can expect to find in this repository:

- `flutter_apps/` - Flutter-based applications and UIs.
- `coding_challenges/` - Solutions to coding challenges, algorithm problems, and competitive programming problems.
- `dart_basics/` - Exploration of basic Dart concepts and syntax.
- `flutter_widgets/` - Custom Flutter widgets, UI components, and tutorials.
- `flutter_advanced/` - Advanced topics in Flutter, such as state management, animations, and performance optimizations.
